4. Write a Python program to print all even numbers from a given numbers list in the same order and stop the printing if any numbers that come after 237 in the sequence.

5. Write a Python function to find all distinct pair of numbers whose product is odd from a sequence of integer values.

6. Write a simple Python program which inputs and stores the data about university students as a list of dictionaries. Your final record structure should look like this:
    ```
     [
         {
             'roll-no': 1211,
             'name': 'Ravi',
             'branch': 'CSE'
         },
         {
             'roll-no': 202,
             'name': 'Abhishek',
             'branch': 'SE'
         },
         {
             'roll-no': 1202,
             'name': 'Sachin',
             'branch': 'IT'
         }
     ]
    ```
