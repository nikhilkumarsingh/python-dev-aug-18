### Project #1

Make a complete flask project with:

    - Add login functionality for users. (Check out [flask-login](https://github.com/maxcountryman/flask-login) package)
    - Users must be able to signup and signin to your webapp.
    - Use MongoDB database on mLab to store usernames and passwords of registered users.

2. REST API
    - Atleast 1 HTTP request of each of the following type: GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE.
    - The API endpoints should be accessible at **/api/** path.
    - Show that your API works by testing it using **requests** library.

Deploy the complete project on cloud platform of your choice!

- Some ideas:
    - A webapp which fetches data from some other web API or using web scraping.
    - A blog like app where users can create new blog articles and see each other's articles.
    - A university management system.

**Note:** The flask project should have both, a frontend and a simple REST API.
